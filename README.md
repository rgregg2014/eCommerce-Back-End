# eCommerce Back End

## Description

This project uses Sequelize with MySQL to run the back end of an e-commerce website. Databases are created using MySQL. Tables are created in JavaScript using Sequelize and data is seeded in the command line. After the server has been launched, users can use an API client platform like Postman or Insomnia Core to check and edit their database. Users can look up individual entries by ID or an index of everything in the database. Entries can be added, deleted, or updated by ID as well.

## Installation
  
Ensure you have Node.js installed, as well as a workbench for MySQL. Run `npm init` and `npm i` to install necessary dependencies. To initiate the connection, run the server.js file in your command line.
  
## Usage
  
After installing the necessary dependencies, run the schema.sql file in your MySQL workbench. Then, in your terminal, run `npm run seed` to seed the database. Run `npm run start` to initiate your server. In your API client, make `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests as you want. I recommend running a `GET` request at your desired endpoint first, to grab the syntax for the body of your other requests.

## Functionality

Below is a link to a brief video displaying the funcionality of the app. The three softwares used are VS Code, MySQL Workbench, and Postman.
